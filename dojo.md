**Things to Know & Things to Learn**

Please see our [skill tree](docs/skill_tree.md) for skill progression 
information and links.

## Getting started

**Basic Dojo Member:** The "easiest" way to gain general membership is to
gain the endorsement of a current member in good standing. If a current member
assists you in preparing a demonstration of the requisite skills defined in the
[skill tree](docs/skill_tree.md) and provides their endorsement, you qualify
for membership in the dojo.

**Intern:** Internships are granted to promissing dojo members who wish to
focus on learning and refining new skills.

To qualify for internship a member must submit a resume outlining their current
competence with the technologies outlined in the skill tree and have the
endorsement of another member active in apprenticeship or above.

Completion of the internship track involves showing competence in the core
technologies outlined in the skill tree as well as a track record with another
skill related to the project.

**Aprentice:** Apprenticeship is for members who have demonstrated core skills
proficiency and have a demonstrated track record of mentorship among the interns and other
members. Apprentices work to refine and expand their skills working on projects 
under the guidance of Zillona Org members.
