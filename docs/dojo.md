## What is Zillona Dojo?

The "Dojo" is the public facing, open source community of Zillona Org.

existing skills and master the core skills needed to collaborate effectively on 
modern technology projects and at the highest levels of the tech industry.

**Dojo Member:** Dojo membership is a blanket term for contributors of all skill
levels and advancement tracks. Prospective members must demonstrate basic
ability with [prerequisite skills](../skill_tree/#prerequisite-skills) in order 
to qualify for membership.

Once a member is accepted they should begin working on completion of the 
[initial skills](../skill_tree/#initial-skills) checklist to prepare their
development environment and qualify for advancement.

Once competency has been demonstrated by completion of the 
[initial skills](../skill_tree/#initial-skills) checklist a member may work
towards completion of other tracks.

**Intern:** Internships are granted to promissing dojo members who wish to
focus on learning and refining new skills. To qualify for an internship a member
must establish completion of the 
[initial skills](../skill_tree/#initial-skills) checklist as well as submit a 
resume outlining their current competence with the technologies outlined in the 
skill tree and have the endorsement of another member active in apprenticeship
